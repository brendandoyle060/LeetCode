# LeetCode
This repo contains my solutions to various problems on <a>https://leetcode.com/</a>, which I'm using to brush up on my Python skills.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

- I completed many of these problems several months ago (before being forced to take a break for several months to deal with work and other responsibilities in my personal life), but since the problems are usually short and not related to each other, I hadn't bothered pushing them to Github until now. That's why I'm pushing a bunch of them all at once - I promise these answers are mine, I'm not just copying them from somewhere! :)

- I recognize that the workflow that I'm currently using (solving each problem on a separate branch, then auto-merging with a PR) is probably complete overkill for a repo with 1 contributor who's typically only working on one branch at a time anyway. The reason I chose to do this is because I don't typically have to do this at my current job - we typically only work on one branch, so I usually only have to add/commit/push. And even in the occasional instances where I do have to create a separate branch and submit a PR, we're using Gitlab at work, and not Github. So while this process is probably a bit of a waste of time given how small of a repo this is, I think it's a good habit to get into, and it's giving me a chance to see how this process looks on Github, rather than on Gitlab like I'm used to.

- While I don't think that I've used any incredibly new or version-specific Python features at the time of this writing, I guess that it's worth noting that I'm currently using Python 3.7.4.
